                 NEURAL ARCHITECT LAB - QUICK DEMO GUIDE
=====================================================================
Use these recommended models to test the application quickly. 
These models are lightweight, download fast, and run smoothly on 
standard laptops (CPU-only friendly).

--- 1. Best for "Attention (Transformer)" Testing ---
Model ID:    distilgpt2
Size:        ~82 MB
Description: A lighter version of GPT-2. Extremely fast. 
             Perfect for testing the "Perplexity" metric immediately.

Model ID:    TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
Size:        ~1.1 GB
Description: A very popular, high-performance small model. 
             Use this to see how the app handles slightly larger loads.

--- 2. Best for "Recurrent (RNN/RWKV)" Testing ---
Model ID:    RWKV/rwkv-4-169m-pile
Size:        ~300 MB
Description: An RNN that acts like a Transformer. Good for showing 
             your app's ability to handle non-standard architectures.
